                Ippo Makunouchi (幕之内一歩, Makunouchi Ippo) is the eponymous protagonist of Hajime no Ippo. He is a trainer, and also a retired featherweight professional boxer from the Kamogawa Boxing Gym and a former reigning featherweight JBC champion.
                He originally started boxing to try and answer one simple question: "What does it mean to be strong?".
                Since that moment onwards, he has formed a rivalry with other boxers, such as Ichirō Miyata, Takeshi Sendō, Ryō Mashiba, a brotherly bond with his peers Mamoru Takamura, Masaru Aoki, Tatsuya Kimura, and a deep trust for his coach, Genji Kamogawa, whom he aims to become a renowned champion to honour the coach's teachings.
                After retiring from boxing, he has become a trainer, being a second for his gym mates while training Taihei Aoki and Kintarō Kaneda.
